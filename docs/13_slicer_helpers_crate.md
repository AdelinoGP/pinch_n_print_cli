# ModularSlicer — slicer-helpers Crate

> **Status (as of this writing).**
> - The `repair`, `decimate`, and STEP import Rust APIs in this document are
>   implemented and shipped in `crates/slicer-helpers/src/`.
> - The CLI subcommands described below are exposed via the **`pnp_cli`**
>   binary (Packet 69). The live invocations are `pnp_cli mesh repair`,
>   `pnp_cli mesh decimate`, `pnp_cli mesh import`, and `pnp_cli mesh convert`.
>   The `slice` operation is served by the `pnp_cli slice` subcommand.
> - On-disk **STL**, **OBJ**, and **3MF** input and output are all wired
>   through. OBJ and 3MF output writers (`write_obj`, `write_3mf`) are
>   implemented in `crates/slicer-runtime/src/model_writer.rs` (Packet 71,
>   TASK-060). The `--format obj`, `--format 3mf`, and `--output-format
>   obj|3mf` flags are fully operational end-to-end.

## Purpose

`slicer-helpers` is a library crate providing **pre-pipeline mesh processing operations**. It runs before any WASM module is loaded and before the slicing pipeline starts. Its outputs are `MeshIR` values (or modified `MeshIR` values) consumed by the host's standard pipeline entry point.

These operations are hosted here because they require native libraries or algorithms that cannot be expressed inside the WASM sandbox, produce or transform `MeshIR` that the pipeline then consumes, and are invoked directly via host CLI subcommands rather than through the module scheduler.

## Coordinate System Contract

All operations in this crate input and output values via `slicer_ir::Point3`,
whose storage is **`f32` in millimetres** today. The "1 internal unit = 100 nm"
hazard described in `docs/08_coordinate_system.md` applies to the per-layer
integer-coordinate modules (Clipper / `slicer-core` polygon math); it does
**not** describe how `MeshIR` vertices are stored. The STEP importer therefore
converts a STEP file's declared units directly into `f32 mm` and stores into
`Point3`. All other operations (repair, decimate) receive and emit already-
converted `mm` coordinates and must not apply any unit conversion.

Reference: `./docs/08_coordinate_system.md` — integer-coord unit definitions
for downstream pipeline modules.

Unit conversion table for STEP import (STEP native → `f32 mm` in `Point3`):

| STEP declared unit       | Factor to `f32 mm` |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| Millimetre (most common) | × 1                |
| Metre                    | × 1,000            |
| Inch                     | × 25.4             |
| Micrometre               | × 0.001            |

If the STEP file declares no unit, the importer must default to millimetres and emit a structured warning.

## Feature: Mesh Repair

### Purpose

Fixes non-manifold geometry in imported meshes so the slicer pipeline always receives a closed, consistently oriented triangle mesh. Equivalent to OrcaSlicer's admesh-based repair pipeline applied at import time.

### Algorithm (Three Phases, Sequential)

**Phase 1 — Degenerate triangle removal**

A triangle is degenerate if its area is below `1e-8` square internal units (approximately 1 nm² in real space). Degenerate triangles are removed before any other operation because they poison normal computation.

Criterion: `||(v1 - v0).cross(v2 - v0)||² < 2e-16`

**Phase 2 — Face orientation normalization**

Starting from the triangle with the most negative Z centroid (chosen for determinism), flood-fill across shared edges and flip any neighbouring triangle whose shared-edge winding is inconsistent with the propagation front.

If the mesh has multiple disconnected components, run one flood-fill per component. Orientation of each component is resolved independently; the final orientation of a component is set so its outward normals point away from its centroid.

**Phase 3 — Open-edge closure**

An open edge is an edge referenced by exactly one triangle. After Phases 1 and 2, collect all open edges, group them into boundary loops by shared vertex, and cap each loop with a fan of triangles originating at the loop centroid.

If a boundary loop contains more than `MAX_REPAIR_CAP_VERTICES = 256` vertices, the repair emits a non-fatal `RepairWarning::LargeCapLoop { vertex_count }` and skips that loop (it is too large to fan-cap reliably without introducing self-intersections). The caller still receives `Ok(result)` with the partially-repaired mesh; the presence of `LargeCapLoop` in `result.stats.warnings` is the signal that one or more components were not fully closed. (There is no per-component `repaired` boolean; the warning vector is the sole indicator.)

### Output

```rust
pub struct RepairResult {
    pub mesh: MeshIR,
    pub stats: RepairStats,
}

pub struct RepairStats {
    pub degenerate_removed: usize,
    pub faces_reoriented: usize,
    pub open_edges_closed: usize,
    pub components: usize,
    pub warnings: Vec<RepairWarning>,
}

pub enum RepairWarning {
    LargeCapLoop { vertex_count: usize },
    MultipleComponents { count: usize },
}
```

### Public API

```rust
/// Repair a mesh in place. Returns a RepairResult.
/// Input mesh may be non-manifold. Output mesh is manifold unless warnings
/// indicate skipped loops.
pub fn repair(mesh: MeshIR) -> Result<RepairResult, RepairError>
```

### CLI Subcommand: `pnp_cli mesh repair`

```
pnp_cli mesh repair --input <path> --output <path> [--format <stl|obj|3mf>] [--stats]

Options:
  --input     Input mesh file (STL, OBJ, or 3MF)
  --output    Output mesh file path
  --format    Output format. Defaults to inferring from the output extension,
              then from the input extension. STL is currently the only wired
              writer; --format obj and --format 3mf return an
              "Unsupported" runtime error.
  --stats     Emit start / warning / done events as line-delimited JSON
              on stderr.
```

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning                                                                |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Repair succeeded; mesh is fully manifold                               |
| 1    | Repair partially succeeded; some loops were skipped (warnings present) |
| 2    | Input file not found or unreadable, or output writer unsupported       |
| 3    | Input mesh is empty                                                    |

## Feature: Mesh Decimation

### Purpose

Reduces triangle count via quadric error metric (QEM) edge collapse. Used to reduce high-resolution imported meshes (photogrammetry scans, STEP tessellations) to a size the slicer pipeline can process efficiently without losing print-relevant detail.

### Library: `meshopt`

Decimation is implemented via the `meshopt` crate (Rust bindings to meshoptimizer), which provides `simplify` (quality-preserving) and `simplify_sloppy` (faster, aggressive) functions. `meshopt` was chosen over a custom QEM implementation because:

- Battle-tested in game engine production use cases
- The `simplify` function implements the same Garland-Heckbert QEM algorithm used in OrcaSlicer's `QuadricEdgeCollapse.cpp`
- Pure C with no LGPL/GPL — clean licensing for redistribution
- No additional geometry library required beyond nalgebra for pre/post-processing

### Algorithm

1. Convert `MeshIR` vertices and indices into `meshopt`'s flat `f32` vertex buffer and `u32` index buffer.
2. Call `meshopt::simplify` with `target_count` and `target_error` derived from CLI arguments.
3. Reconstruct a `MeshIR` from the simplified buffers.
4. Run a single pass of Phase 2 (orientation normalization) from the repair module to correct any winding inconsistencies introduced by edge collapse.

`MeshIR` vertices are already `f32 mm` (`slicer_ir::Point3`), so the
conversion to meshopt's flat `f32` buffer is a direct copy. Phase 2 from
`repair.rs` is run on each compacted `IndexedTriangleSet` before it is
returned, so any winding inconsistencies introduced by edge collapse are
normalised before downstream consumers see the result.

### Configuration

| Parameter      | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target_count` | `usize` | —       | Absolute target triangle count. Mutually exclusive with `target_ratio`.                                    |
| `target_ratio` | `f32`   | —       | Fraction of original count to retain (0.0–1.0). Mutually exclusive with `target_count`.                    |
| `max_error`    | `f32`   | `0.01`  | Maximum allowed quadric error in internal units. Decimation stops early if this would be exceeded.         |
| `aggressive`   | `bool`  | `false` | Use `simplify_sloppy` instead of `simplify`. Faster but may produce lower-quality results near boundaries. |

Exactly one of `target_count` or `target_ratio` must be specified. Construct
`DecimateConfig` via [`DecimateConfigBuilder`]; `build()` validates the
exactly-one-target rule and `max_error > 0.0`, returning
`DecimateError::InvalidConfig` on violation.

### Output

```rust
pub struct DecimateResult {
    pub mesh: MeshIR,
    pub original_triangle_count: usize,
    pub final_triangle_count: usize,
    pub achieved_error: f32,
}
```

### Public API

```rust
pub struct DecimateConfigBuilder { /* private */ }

impl DecimateConfigBuilder {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn target_count(self, n: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn target_ratio(self, ratio: f32) -> Self;
    pub fn max_error(self, e: f32) -> Self;
    pub fn aggressive(self, b: bool) -> Self;
    pub fn build(self) -> Result<DecimateConfig, DecimateError>;
}

pub fn decimate(mesh: MeshIR, config: DecimateConfig) -> Result<DecimateResult, DecimateError>

/// Douglas-Peucker polyline simplification in millimetres (packet 60).
/// `tolerance_mm = 0.0` short-circuits and returns the input unchanged
/// (zero-cost legacy path). Used at per-role G-code emit for wall, infill,
/// and support polyline simplification.
pub fn simplify_polyline_mm(
    points: &[Point3WithWidth],
    tolerance_mm: f32,
) -> Vec<Point3WithWidth>;

/// Drop adjacent segments shorter than `min_segment_length_mm` (packet 60).
/// Preserves endpoints unconditionally; collapses runs of short segments
/// into single segments to the next viable vertex. `min_segment_length_mm
/// = 0.0` is a no-op (zero-cost legacy path).
pub fn drop_short_segments_mm(
    points: &[Point3WithWidth],
    min_segment_length_mm: f32,
) -> Vec<Point3WithWidth>;
```

### CLI Subcommand: `pnp_cli mesh decimate`

```
pnp_cli mesh decimate --input <path> --output <path>
                     (--target-count <n> | --target-ratio <0.0–1.0>)
                     [--max-error <f32>]
                     [--aggressive]
                     [--stats]

Options:
  --input          Input mesh file (STL, OBJ, or 3MF)
  --output         Output mesh file path (STL only at present; see status header)
  --target-count   Absolute target triangle count
  --target-ratio   Fraction of triangles to retain (e.g. 0.25 = keep 25%)
  --max-error      Maximum quadric error budget (default: 0.01)
  --aggressive     Use sloppy simplification (faster, lower quality)
  --stats          Emit start / done events as line-delimited JSON on stderr.
```

`--target-count` and `--target-ratio` are mutually exclusive and exactly one
is required. clap enforces this at parse time via an `ArgGroup`.

| 3    | Input mesh is empty or has fewer triangles than target                            |

## Feature: STEP Import

### Purpose

Converts STEP (ISO 10303) files to triangulated `MeshIR`. STEP is common for mechanical CAD parts (gears, enclosures, brackets) that users may wish to print. Unity has no STEP support; the CLI handles conversion before the mesh is passed to the frontend or pipeline.

### Library: `truck`

STEP import is implemented using the `truck` crate ecosystem (pure Rust CAD kernel):

- `truck-stepio`: STEP AP203/AP214 parser — reads B-Rep solids from `.step`/`.stp` files
- `truck-meshing`: triangulates B-Rep shells into indexed triangle meshes

`truck` was chosen over an OpenCASCADE FFI binding because:

- Pure Rust — no C++ build dependency, cross-compiles cleanly to all target platforms
- AP203 and AP214 coverage is sufficient for mechanical FDM print use cases
- Maintained actively as of 2026
- No LGPL entanglement

**Limitation:** `truck-stepio` does not support AP242 (the newer STEP standard used by Siemens NX and CATIA for assemblies with PMI). If an AP242-specific construct is encountered, the importer emits a non-fatal `StepWarning::UnsupportedSchema` and attempts to parse the geometry portions anyway.

### Pipeline

```
.step / .stp file
       │
       ▼
truck-stepio::read()          — parse STEP entities into B-Rep shell(s)
       │
       ▼
unit normalization             — read LENGTH_UNIT from STEP header,
       │                         apply conversion factor to all vertices
       ▼
truck-meshing::triangulate()  — tessellate each B-Rep shell into
       │                         indexed triangle mesh; tolerance = 100 nm
       ▼
component merging              — if STEP file contains multiple solids,
       │                         each becomes a separate MeshIR (array output)
       ▼
repair pass                    — Phase 1 + Phase 2 of mesh repair applied
       │                         to each component automatically
       ▼
Vec<MeshIR>                   — one MeshIR per solid in the STEP file
```

### Tessellation Tolerance

The triangulation tolerance passed to `truck-meshing` is fixed at **100 nm** (1 internal unit). This matches the coordinate system resolution and ensures no geometric detail finer than 1 internal unit is lost during tessellation.

Finer tolerances produce more triangles without slicing benefit. Coarser tolerances may lose sharp edges on small features. The value is not user-configurable at the CLI level; use `pnp_cli mesh decimate` afterward to reduce triangle count if needed.

### Output

```rust
pub struct StepImportResult {
    pub meshes: Vec<NamedMesh>,
    pub source_unit: StepLengthUnit,
    pub warnings: Vec<StepWarning>,
}

pub struct NamedMesh {
    pub name: Option<String>,   // STEP entity label if present
    pub mesh: MeshIR,
}

pub enum StepLengthUnit {
    Millimetre,
    Metre,
    Inch,
    Micrometre,
    Unknown,                    // triggers default-to-mm warning
}

pub enum StepWarning {
    UnsupportedSchema { schema: String },
    UnknownUnit,
    RepairApplied { component_index: usize, stats: RepairStats },
    MultipleComponents { count: usize },
}
```

```rust
/// Import a STEP file with default options (repair pass enabled).
/// Returns one MeshIR per solid found in the file.
pub fn import_step(path: &Path) -> Result<StepImportResult, StepImportError>

/// Options for [`import_step_with_options`].
pub struct StepImportOptions {
    /// When `true`, skip the automatic Phase 1+2 repair pass applied to each
    /// tessellated component. Exposed so the CLI's `--no-repair` flag can

```

### CLI Subcommand: `pnp_cli mesh import`

                   --output <path>
                   [--output-format <stl|obj|3mf>]

                   [--no-repair]
                   [--stats]

Options:
  --input             Input STEP or STP file
  --output            Output mesh file path. If the STEP file contains multiple
                      solids and --merge-components is not set, output path is

                      where <ext> is taken from the supplied --output extension.
  --output-format     Output format (default: stl; obj and 3mf are fully
                      operational — see §Mesh output writers)
  --merge-components  Merge all solids into a single MeshIR before output
  --no-repair         Skip the automatic repair pass (sets
                      StepImportOptions { skip_repair: true })
  --stats             Emit start / warning / done events as line-delimited
                      JSON on stderr.

---

## Error Types (Normative)

Each operation has its own error enum. All errors implement `std::error::Error` and are structured for programmatic consumption by the host.

```rust
pub enum RepairError {
    EmptyMesh,
    IoError(std::io::Error),
}

pub enum DecimateError {
    EmptyMesh,
    InvalidConfig(String),   // e.g. both target_count and target_ratio specified
    IoError(std::io::Error),
}

pub enum StepImportError {
    FileNotFound(PathBuf),
    ParseError(String),
    NoGeometry,
    IoError(std::io::Error),
}
```

Warnings are **not** errors. Operations that produce warnings still return `Ok(result)` with the warnings embedded in the result struct. The CLI prints warnings to stderr and uses exit code 1 to indicate their presence.

## Mesh output writers (OBJ / 3MF)

Both writers live in `crates/slicer-runtime/src/model_writer.rs` and serialize `MeshIR` to geometry-only wire formats. They do not touch the WASM runtime or the slicing pipeline.

### Public API

```rust
/// Write a MeshIR as a Wavefront OBJ file.
pub fn write_obj(mesh: &MeshIR, w: &mut impl Write) -> Result<(), ModelWriterError>

/// Write a MeshIR as an OrcaSlicer-shaped OPC 3MF package.
pub fn write_3mf(mesh: &MeshIR, w: impl Write + Seek) -> Result<(), ModelWriterError>
```

### OBJ format

`write_obj` emits a minimal Wavefront OBJ: one `v x y z` line per vertex (millimetres, shortest round-trip f32 representation) and one `f i j k` line per triangle (1-based). No material, texture, or normal lines are emitted.

### 3MF format

`write_3mf` produces an OrcaSlicer-shaped OPC package with the following fixed entry set:

| OPC entry path                    | Content                                      |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `[Content_Types].xml`             | OPC content-type manifest                    |
| `_rels/.rels`                     | Root relationship pointing at `3D/3dmodel.model` |
| `3D/3dmodel.model`                | Core geometry, `<model unit="millimeter">` with namespace `http://schemas.microsoft.com/3dmanufacturing/core/2015/02` |
| `Metadata/model_settings.config`  | Sidecar `<part subtype="normal_part">` skeleton (no paint or region data) |

One `<object type="model">` element is emitted per `MeshIR` object, followed by a `<build><item>` entry using the identity transform `1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0`. Vertices are emitted in millimetres as-is — no unit conversion is applied, consistent with how `MeshIR` stores coordinates.

**Round-trip guarantee.** Vertex coordinates are serialized using shortest-round-trip f32 formatting so that `load_3mf → write_3mf → load_3mf` produces bit-exact vertex values.

**Paint and region data** (OrcaSlicer face-paint layers, support-enforcer volumes) are GUI-authored and are intentionally out of scope. The sidecar skeleton is included for OrcaSlicer compatibility but carries no annotations.

**Splitting vs. serializing.** `write_3mf` is a pure 1:1 serializer: one `<object>` per `MeshIR` object, no topology analysis. Connected-component splitting happens upstream in the CLI (`pnp_cli mesh convert`), never inside the writer.

---

## `mesh convert` (split-to-objects)

`pnp_cli mesh convert` loads an existing STL, OBJ, or 3MF file, optionally repairs it, splits it into connected components, and writes the result in the requested output format. It is the front-end for the `split_connected_components` function in `crates/slicer-helpers/src/split.rs`.

### CLI reference

```
pnp_cli mesh convert --input <path>
                     --output <path>
                     [--output-format <stl|obj|3mf>]
                     [--format <stl|obj|3mf>]       (alias for --output-format)
                     [--merge-components]
                     [--repair]
                     [--stats]

Options:
  --input            Input mesh file (STL, OBJ, or 3MF)
  --output           Output path; used as a stem when multiple components are
                     written (<stem>_0.<ext>, <stem>_1.<ext>, …)
  --output-format    Output format; default inferred from --output extension
  --format           Alias for --output-format
  --merge-components Write all components as a single output object instead of
                     splitting into N files
  --repair           Run the standard repair pass on each component before writing
  --stats            Emit start / done events as line-delimited JSON on stderr
```

### Splitting behaviour

Connected-component detection uses OrcaSlicer's `its_split` adjacency model: two triangles belong to the same component if they share an edge **and** their shared-edge windings are opposite (i.e. normal manifold adjacency). No area or volume threshold is applied — a single isolated triangle becomes its own component.

Unless `--merge-components` is passed, each component is written to a separate file. With `--merge-components` all components are merged into one `MeshIR` before the write step.

### `.step` / `.stp` inputs are rejected

`mesh convert` does not accept STEP inputs. Passing a `.step` or `.stp` file exits with code `UNREADABLE` and a message directing the user to `pnp_cli mesh import`, which handles STEP tessellation.

### Relationship to `mesh import`

`pnp_cli mesh import --output-format 3mf` (without `--merge-components`) now combines all STEP solids from the source file into a **single** `.3mf` package containing N `<object>` entries — one per solid. STL and OBJ inputs routed through `mesh convert` keep the per-file `_i` split behaviour described above.

Exit codes:

| Code         | Meaning                                               |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | All components written successfully                   |
| 1            | Partial success; some components produced warnings    |
| `UNREADABLE` | Input format not supported (e.g. `.step`/`.stp`)      |
| 2            | Input file not found or unreadable                    |
| 3            | Input contains no geometry                            |

## Integration with Host CLI

The helpers are exposed via the `pnp_cli` binary's clap subcommand surface
under the `mesh` verb. The `pnp_cli` binary hosts the STL/OBJ/3MF mesh
loaders (`crates/slicer-runtime/src/model_loader.rs`) and the JSON-Lines
emitter machinery (`crates/slicer-runtime/src/progress_events.rs`).

```
pnp_cli slice             — full slicing pipeline (WASM modules, scheduler)
pnp_cli module config-schema — query combined config schema from loaded modules
pnp_cli mesh repair       — slicer_helpers::repair()
pnp_cli mesh decimate     — slicer_helpers::decimate()
pnp_cli mesh import       — slicer_helpers::import_step_with_options()
pnp_cli mesh convert      — slicer_helpers::split_connected_components() + model_writer
```

The three mesh subcommands are implemented in
`crates/slicer-runtime/src/helpers_cmd.rs`. They do not initialise the WASM
runtime — they short-circuit before any module loading happens.

When `--stats` is passed, each subcommand emits a sequence of line-delimited
JSON events to **stderr**. The envelope is a flat `{"event": "<name>",
"operation": "repair|decimate|import", ...payload}` shape (intentionally
distinct from the slice-pipeline `ProgressEvent` schema in
`./docs/09_progress_events.md`, which carries `slice_id`, `phase`, and
other fields that do not apply to one-shot mesh operations). Event names
are `start`, `warning` (zero or more), and `done`.

Example output for `pnp_cli mesh repair --stats`:

```jsonc
{"event":"start","operation":"repair","input":"in.stl","output":"out.stl"}
{"event":"done","operation":"repair","degenerate_removed":14,
 "faces_reoriented":3,"open_edges_closed":0,"components":1,"warnings":[]}
```

## TDD Contract

Tests must be written and confirmed failing before any implementation begins. Each test file maps to one feature module.
