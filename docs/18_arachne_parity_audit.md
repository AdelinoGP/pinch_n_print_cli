# 18 — Arachne Parity Audit (2026-07-09, second round)

Read-only audit of the Arachne implementation on `parity/arachne`
(`34ce576e`) against the canonical OrcaSlicer reference at
`OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/`. This is the **second** audit round:
the first round's deliverable is `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/arachne_parity.rs`,
whose gaps were largely closed by packets 148/149 (its tests are now green
regression locks, except the still-red concentric-infill test).

**Deliverable of this round:** `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/arachne_parity_gaps.rs`
— 10 red tests, one per open gap, each failing with a
`PARITY GAP: <feature> | expected | got | ref` message. Fixtures:
`crates/slicer-runtime/tests/fixtures/arachne_parity/mod.rs` (programmatic,
no STL needed). Run with:

```bash
cargo test -p slicer-runtime --test arachne_parity_gaps
```

All 10 tests MUST fail until their gap is fixed. Do not `#[ignore]` or weaken
them; each test body already asserts the correct end state, so closing a gap
turns its test green with no rewrite.

Numbering note: this doc is `18_` because `15_` (config keys), `16_`
(slicer report) and `17_` (agent debugging) were already taken.

## What is at parity (do NOT re-audit)

The core Arachne engine reached canonical parity through packets 110–113c and
the N1–N13 chain (packets 141–147, ADR-0035, D-147-CHAIN-CLOSURE):

| Subsystem | PnP path | Closure |
|---|---|---|
| Voronoi / SkeletalTrapezoidation graph | `crates/slicer-core/src/voronoi.rs`, `crates/slicer-core/src/skeletal_trapezoidation/` | P110, P113b/c |
| BeadingStrategy stack (Distributed, Redistribute, Widening, OuterWallInset, Limited) | `crates/slicer-core/src/beading/` | P111, D-111 |
| Junction generation / connectJunctions / transitions | `crates/slicer-core/src/arachne/generate_toolpaths.rs` | D-141…D-146 |
| Post-process order (stitch → remove_small → separate inner contour → simplify → remove empty) | `crates/slicer-core/src/arachne/{stitch,remove_small,separate_inner_contour,simplify}.rs` | D-146-POSTPROCESS-ORDER |
| Per-vertex parity flags (overhang_quartile, is_bridge, is_thin_wall, boundary_type, seam candidates, precise_outer_wall) | `modules/core-modules/arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs` | P148 (D-104 closed) |
| alternate_extra_wall, extra_perimeters_on_overhangs, bridge_flow (thin branch) | module + `crates/slicer-core/src/flow.rs` | P149 (D-104e closed) |
| Module selection via `wall_generator` | `crates/slicer-scheduler/src/execution_plan.rs:182-260` | D-112-WALL-GENERATOR-SELECT |

Deliberate divergences (documented, NOT locked by red tests): Visvalingam–
Whyatt simplify instead of Orca's triangle-height heuristic (ADR-0035,
D-112-SIMPLIFY-DP-addendum); `detect_thin_wall` as a config key vs Orca's
hardcoded `fill_outline_gaps = true` (`WallToolPaths.hpp:18`); PnP default
`wall_generator = "classic"` vs Orca default Arachne.

## Open gaps (each locked by a red test)

Categories: **CONFIG** (key exposure), **ALGO** (behavior), **INTEG**
(pipeline dispatch), **MODEL** (data/config model). All tests live in
`arachne_parity_gaps.rs` unless stated otherwise.

### G1 — `wall_direction` winding control (CONFIG + ALGO) — closed (packet 151)
- **Closed (packet 151):** `wall_direction` is now registered on
  `arachne-perimeters.toml` (enum CCW/CW, default CCW) and applied to contour /
  hole winding in the module; `wall_count` is registered and translated to
  `max_bead_count = 2 × wall_count`. See `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md`
  D-151-WALLCOUNT-MAXBEAD-UNWIRED and AC-1/G1 tests.
- OrcaSlicer: `PrintConfig.cpp:2188-2198` (enum CCW/CW, default CCW);
  applied via `make_counter_clockwise/make_clockwise` in
  `PerimeterGenerator.cpp:527-545`; holes wound opposite the contour.
- PnP: zero readers of `wall_direction` anywhere in `crates/` or `modules/`;
  key not in `arachne-perimeters.toml`.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_wall_direction_controls_winding`.

### G2 — `only_one_wall_first_layer` (CONFIG + ALGO) — closed (packet 151)
- **Closed (packet 151):** `only_one_wall_first_layer` is now registered on
  `arachne-perimeters.toml` and forces a single wall (`max_bead_count = 2`) on
  layer 0; see the G2 test (now green).
- OrcaSlicer: `PrintConfig.cpp:1513-1517`; forces `loop_number = 0` on the
  first printed layer, `PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2137-2139`.
- PnP: key unregistered, wall count never reduced on layer 0.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_only_one_wall_first_layer_forces_single_wall`.

### G3 — `only_one_wall_top` behaviorally inert (ALGO)
- OrcaSlicer: topmost layer forces `loop_number = 0`
  (`PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2140-2144`); non-topmost top surfaces get a
  SECOND `Arachne::WallToolPaths` pass over non-top area with `inset_idx`
  renumbering and `min_width_top_surface`-based top-area derivation
  (`PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2160-2246`, second constructor at `:2242`).
- PnP: module reads the key and discards it
  (`arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs:305-306`, deferred under
  D-104d-MIN-WIDTH-TOP-SURFACE-NONE).
- Test: `arachne_parity_arachne_path_only_one_wall_top_forces_single_wall_on_top`.

### G4 — Wall gap uses Flow spacing, not raw width (ALGO, D-105) — closed (packet 150)
- **Closed (packet 150):** `slicer_core::flow::line_width_to_spacing` is now wired into
  bead placement in both `classic-perimeters` and `arachne-perimeters` (was raw
  width); see `docs/15_config_keys_reference.md` and `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` D-105
  (now closed).
- **Packet 154 note (2026-07-14) — thin-strip collapse was masking G4's own
  observability, not G4's wiring.** The 4 thin-strip parity tests (and, on
  narrow geometry, the G4 test itself) were RED for a period after D-105
  landed — but the cause was an unrelated, upstream defect: `preprocess.rs`
  stage 2 dropped a thin strip's corner on segment length alone before the
  medial-axis graph was ever built, collapsing the graph to one vertex and
  zeroing the wall loop's length (root-caused and fixed as D-105D). G4's own
  Flow-spacing wiring — the `line_width_to_spacing` wiring landed in packet
  150 above — was already correct throughout and its own test was already
  green; packet 154 did not touch G4's wiring and did not need to. This note
  exists only to record that the thin-strip red tests were never a G4
  regression.
- OrcaSlicer: `bead_width_0 = ext_perimeter_spacing`
  (`PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2129`); `WallToolPaths` receives
  `perimeter_spacing = perimeter_flow.scaled_spacing()`
  (`PerimeterGenerator.cpp:578, 2172-2173`; `Flow.hpp:67`) — spacing is
  layer-height dependent (width − h·(1 − π/4)).
- PnP: raw `optimal_width` used; `layer_height` never read;
  `slicer_core::flow::line_width_to_spacing` exists but unwired
  (D-105-FLOW-NOT-WIRED). Observed centerline gap 0.4000 mm vs expected
  ≈0.3571 mm at 0.4 mm width / 0.2 mm layers.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_wall_gap_uses_flow_spacing_not_width`.

### G5 — `thick_bridges` bridging flow stubbed to 1.0 (ALGO, D-104g) — closed (packet 150)
- **Closed (packet 150):** `bridging_flow`'s `thick_bridges == true` branch now
  computes the round cross-section formula `π·dmr²/(4·w·h)`
  (`dmr = nozzle_diameter·sqrt(bridge_flow_ratio)`) instead of a hardcoded `1.0`;
  see `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` D-104g (now closed).
- OrcaSlicer: `overhang_flow = bridging_flow(frPerimeter, thick_bridges)`
  (`LayerRegion.cpp:135`, impl `:31-50`); with thick bridges the flow is a
  round cross-section of thread diameter (`Flow.hpp:106`), ≈1.57× a flat
  0.4×0.2 mm bead.
- PnP: `slicer_core::flow::bridging_flow`'s `thick_bridges == true` branch
  returns hardcoded `1.0` (`crates/slicer-core/src/flow.rs:85-92`). Observed
  bridge-vertex flow factors: all 1.0.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_thick_bridges_flow_factor_not_stubbed_to_one`.

### G6 — No percent / float-or-percent config type (MODEL, D-104h) — closed (packet 150)
- **Closed (packet 150):** new `percent`/`float_or_percent` config-schema types,
  resolved module-side via `ConfigView::get_abs_value(key, base)`; see
  `docs/03_wit_and_manifest.md` §Config Field Types Reference and
  `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` D-104h (now closed).
- OrcaSlicer: `min_width_top_surface` coFloatOrPercent 300%
  (`PrintConfig.cpp:1498-1511`); `min_feature_size` coPercent 25%
  (`:7217-7226`); `wall_transition_length` coPercent 100% (`:7169-7178`);
  all relative to nozzle diameter / wall width.
- PnP: keys declared `type = "float"` with pre-resolved absolute defaults
  (`arachne-perimeters.toml:38-42, 68-72, 257-261`); nozzle changes leave
  them stale.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_percent_config_type_for_arachne_keys`.

### G7 — `overhang_reverse` registration-only (ALGO, D-104c) — closed (packet 151)
- **Closed (packet 151):** `overhang_reverse` odd-layer reversal is now wired in
  `arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs`, and `overhang_reverse_threshold` is
  registered; see `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` D-104c-OVERHANG-REVERSE-NONE (now
  closed) and the G7 test (AC-4, now green).
- OrcaSlicer: with `detect_overhang_wall` off + `overhang_reverse` on,
  contour/holes unconditionally marked steep and reversed on odd layers
  (`PerimeterGenerator.cpp:422-429`; `detect_steep_overhang` `:58-98`;
  applied in `traverse_extrusions` `:370-523`); tunable via
  `overhang_reverse_threshold` (coFloatOrPercent).
- PnP: `overhang_reverse` / `overhang_reverse_internal_only` /
  `detect_overhang_wall` registered but have zero readers in the module;
  `overhang_reverse_threshold` unregistered. Toggling changes nothing.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_overhang_reverse_flips_odd_layer_walls`.

### G8 — Spiral vase does not force the classic generator (INTEG) — closed (packet 151)
- **Closed (packet 151):** the scheduler now forces
  `com.core.classic-perimeters` when `spiral_vase = true`, regardless of
  `wall_generator`, mirroring OrcaSlicer's `!spiral_mode` Arachne-dispatch gate;
  see `docs/04_host_scheduler.md` §"Perimeter-generator selection" and the G8
  test (now green).
- OrcaSlicer: Arachne dispatch gated on `wall_generator == Arachne &&
  !spiral_mode` (`LayerRegion.cpp:138-141`).
- PnP: `dedup_same_claim_modules_with_wall_generator`
  (`crates/slicer-scheduler/src/execution_plan.rs:256-261`, called from
  `crates/slicer-runtime/src/run.rs:342`) keys only off `wall_generator`;
  no spiral-vase input exists anywhere in the selection path.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_spiral_vase_forces_classic_generator`.

### G9 — `wall_maximum_resolution` / `wall_maximum_deviation` unregistered (CONFIG) — closed (packet 151)
- **Closed (packet 151):** both keys are now registered on
  `arachne-perimeters.toml` (defaults 0.5 mm / 0.025 mm) and wired directly into
  `ArachneParams.smallest_line_segment_squared` / `allowed_error_distance_squared`
  as mm² (no min()/merge); see `docs/15_config_keys_reference.md` §"Wall count,
  winding, and simplification tolerances" and the G9 test (now green).
- OrcaSlicer: `PrintConfig.cpp:7242-7263` (defaults 0.5 mm / 0.025 mm),
  consumed by outline prep (`WallToolPaths.cpp:487-503`) and
  `simplifyToolPaths` (`:702-719`).
- PnP: internal equivalents exist
  (`ArachneParams.smallest_line_segment_squared` /
  `allowed_error_distance_squared`, `pipeline.rs:149-154`) but are
  compile-time defaults, never config-driven.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_wall_max_resolution_deviation_registered`.

### G10 — `removeSmallLines` top-layer exception conflated with layer 0 (ALGO)
- OrcaSlicer: lenient `min_width/2` threshold applies on top **or** bottom
  layers (`WallToolPaths.cpp:684-700`; `is_top_or_bottom_layer =
  is_bottom_layer || is_topmost_layer`, `PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2153-2154`).
- PnP: `remove_small_lines` keys the lenient threshold on
  `is_initial_layer` only (`crates/slicer-core/src/arachne/remove_small.rs:44-80`);
  neither it nor `run_arachne_pipeline` can express "topmost layer", so
  top-surface thin walls are dropped by the strict threshold.
- Test: `arachne_parity_arachne_path_remove_small_lines_top_layer_exception`.

### G11 — Concentric infill not routed through Arachne (INTEG, D-104f)
- OrcaSlicer: `FillConcentric.cpp:80-118`, `FillConcentricInternal.cpp:29-55`.
- PnP: no infill module references the Arachne pipeline.
- Test: `arachne_parity_pipeline_concentric_infill_uses_arachne` —
  **pre-existing red test in `arachne_parity.rs`** (first-round audit); not
  duplicated here.

## Known residuals tracked elsewhere (no new test)

- **AC-1 e2e outer-wall closure** — `cube_4color_arachne_outer_walls_close_end_to_end`
  (`crates/slicer-runtime/tests/executor/cube_4color_arachne.rs`) is kept
  `#[ignore]`d by explicit user decision 2026-07-08 (D-147-CHAIN-CLOSURE
  residual, 49.33% closure rate). The ignored test already encodes the gap.
- **Self-captured fixtures** — all Arachne parity baselines are self-captured,
  not OrcaSlicer-oracle outputs (D-109 / D-112-SELFCAPTURED-BASELINES, open,
  accepted).
- **`wall_sequence` ownership** — `InnerOuterInner` reordering exists in
  `perimeter_utils` / classic, but ownership is split with
  `path-optimization-default` contra ADR-0011 (DEV-070, open). Behavior for
  the Arachne path should be re-verified once DEV-070 is remediated.

| G7 | `overhang_reverse` odd-layer reversal | `PerimeterGenerator.cpp:58-98,422-429` | closed (packet 151) — odd-layer reversal wired + `overhang_reverse_threshold` registered | `..._overhang_reverse_flips_odd_layer_walls` |

| G10 | `removeSmallLines` top-layer exception | `WallToolPaths.cpp:684-700` | closed (packet 152) — `is-topmost-layer`/`is-bottom-layer` added to `arachne-params`; `remove_small_lines` now keys the lenient threshold on top-or-bottom (G10) | `..._remove_small_lines_top_layer_exception` |
| G11 | Concentric infill via Arachne | `FillConcentric.cpp:80-118` | missing (D-104f) | `arachne_parity.rs::..._concentric_infill_uses_arachne` |

## Porting reminders for the fixing agent

- 1 PnP unit = 100 nm; divide OrcaSlicer scaled constants by 100
  (`docs/08_coordinate_system.md`). Use `Point2::from_mm` / `mm_to_units`.
- Config keys snake_case; new keys go in `arachne-perimeters.toml`
  `[config.schema.*]` AND must be read via `ConfigView` in the module.
- G4/G5/G6 need `layer_height` / `nozzle_diameter` plumbed into the module's
  resolved config before the formulas can be computed.
- G8 belongs in the scheduler/runtime selection path, not the module.
- G10's fix requires extending `run_arachne_pipeline` (and the
  `generate-arachne-walls` host-service WIT contract — see WIT/type-change
  checklist in `CLAUDE.md`) with a top/bottom-layer flag distinct from
  `is_initial_layer`.

# Round 3 (2026-07-13) — Orchestrator gap augmentation

Third augmentation of the audit. Filtered the 10 red tests in
`arachne_parity_gaps.rs` (G1–G10 + G11's still-red lock) and surfaced three
genuinely-new gaps not yet red-tested, all on `parity/arachne` @ `34ce576e`.

**Deliverable of this round:** `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/arachne_parity_round2.rs`
— 3 red tests, one per open gap, each failing with a
`PARITY GAP: <feature> | expected | got | ref` message. Fixtures appended
to `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/fixtures/arachne_parity/mod.rs`
(`ex_polygons_concentric_islands_mm`, `beading_stack_for_split_middle`,
`simplify_input_intersection_distance_gate`). Run with:

```bash
cargo test -p slicer-runtime --test arachne_parity_round2
```

All 3 tests MUST fail until their gap is fixed. Do not `#[ignore]` or weaken
them; each test body already asserts the correct end state, so closing a gap
turns its test green with no rewrite.

## Summary

Re-verifying the Phase-1C "set, NOT consumed" notes shows two of them are
stale: `initial_layer_min_bead_width` (`pipeline.rs:281-285` swaps
`min_output_width` on `is_initial_layer`) and `wall_transition_angle`
(`pipeline.rs:353` feeds `filter_central`) are both wired. The three
genuinely-new gaps this round surfaces are: (G12) OrcaSlicer's
"odd-after-enclosing" region ordering (`WallToolPaths::getRegionOrder`) is
absent from the PnP pipeline; (G15) `BeadingStrategy::getSplitMiddleThreshold`
is not part of the `BeadingStrategy` trait surface; (G20) `ExtrusionLine::simplify`
is missing OrcaSlicer's `dist_greater` intersection-distance gate that prevents
removing a junction whose replacement intersection would be too far from either
neighbor. `G11` (concentric infill via Arachne) is already red in
`arachne_parity.rs` and is intentionally NOT duplicated here.

Two candidate gaps the round-2 synthesis subagent originally proposed were
re-verified against the OrcaSlicer source and DROPPED:

- ~~G18 — `ExtrusionJunction` equality ignoring `flow_factor`~~ — OrcaSlicer's
  `ExtrusionJunction` struct has no `flow_factor`/`overhang_quartile` fields
  (`OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/Arachne/utils/ExtrusionJunction.hpp:19-39`);
  PnP's `Point3WithWidth` is a strict superset, and how equality treats those
  extra fields is a PnP design decision, not a parity gap.
- ~~G19 — `getNonlinearThicknesses` populating a nonlinear profile~~ —
  OrcaSlicer's own `BeadingStrategy::getNonlinearThicknesses` returns `{}`
  by default (`OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/Arachne/BeadingStrategy/BeadingStrategy.cpp:44-47`),
  matching the Rust impl.

## Gap summary table (round 3)

| # | OrcaSlicer feature | Ref | PnP status | Red test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G12 | `WallToolPaths::getRegionOrder` (odd-after-enclosing) | `WallToolPaths.cpp:809`; `PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2302` | missing — `pipeline.rs:383` flattens per-inset buckets in source order | `arachne_parity_round2::..._wall_region_order_odd_after_enclosing` |
| G15 | `BeadingStrategy::getSplitMiddleThreshold` (split-middle rule) | `BeadingStrategy.hpp:97`; `BeadingStrategy.cpp:54-57`; `BeadingStrategy.cpp:72-73` | closed (packet 155-arachne-beading-simplify-parity) | `arachne_parity_round2::..._beading_split_middle_threshold_exposed` |
| G20 | `ExtrusionLine::simplify` `dist_greater` intersection-distance gate | `Arachne/utils/ExtrusionLine.cpp:163-175` | closed (packet 155-arachne-beading-simplify-parity) | `arachne_parity_round2::..._simplify_intersection_distance_gate_present` |

## Detailed gaps

### G12: Wall region order — odd-after-enclosing (Algorithm)

**OrcaSlicer:** `WallToolPaths::getRegionOrder` (`WallToolPaths.cpp:809`),
called from `PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2302`, orders the emitted toolpath
regions so an inner (odd) region is emitted *after* the enclosing even
region.

**Rust:** NOT PRESENT. `run_arachne_pipeline`
(`crates/slicer-core/src/arachne/pipeline.rs:383`) does
`buckets.into_iter().flatten()` — the per-inset buckets are emitted in
source/inset order with no reordering pass.

**Expected:** for nested concentric islands, the outer-wall `ExtrusionLine`s
precede the inner-wall `ExtrusionLine`s in the returned `Vec`
(odd-after-enclosing).

**Current:** output ordering follows source polygon / inset index only; an
inner region may be emitted before its enclosing region.

**Test:** `arachne_parity_wall_region_order_odd_after_enclosing`

**Panic message:** `PARITY GAP: wall region order odd-after-enclosing |
expected: emitted wall regions ordered so inner (odd) region follows its
enclosing even region (WallToolPaths.cpp:809, PerimeterGenerator.cpp:2302) |
got: pipeline flattens per-inset buckets in source order with no
getRegionOrder pass (pipeline.rs:383) | ref: WallToolPaths.cpp:809`

### G15: `BeadingStrategy::getSplitMiddleThreshold` not on the trait (Data Model)

**PnP status:** closed (packet 155-arachne-beading-simplify-parity) — the `BeadingStrategy` trait gained `get_split_middle_threshold` + `get_add_middle_threshold` (required, both forwarding through all four decorators to `DistributedBeadingStrategy`), and `RedistributeBeadingStrategy`'s `optimal_bead_count`/`get_transition_thickness`/`optimal_thickness` now consult the split-middle threshold. See `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` D-155.
(`BeadingStrategy.hpp:97`, `.cpp:54-57`) returns the thickness at which the
middle bead is split; `RedistributeBeadingStrategy` uses it for its
`optimal_bead_count`/`getTransitionThickness` math (the threshold is also
referenced at `BeadingStrategy.cpp:72-73` to pick
`wall_split_middle_threshold` vs `wall_add_middle_threshold`).

**Rust:** `BeadingStrategy` trait (`crates/slicer-core/src/beading/mod.rs`)
has no such method; `redistribute.rs:31-37` explicitly notes the method is
absent and delegates `optimal_bead_count`/`get_transition_thickness`/
`optimal_thickness` to `parent` unchanged.

**Expected:** the trait exposes `getSplitMiddleThreshold` and
`RedistributeBeadingStrategy::optimal_bead_count` consults it (matching
Orca's split-middle behavior).

**Current:** method absent; `RedistributeBeadingStrategy` cannot split the
middle bead, so its bead-count selection diverges from Orca for odd/middle
regimes.

**Test:** `arachne_parity_beading_split_middle_threshold_exposed`

**Panic message:** `PARITY GAP: BeadingStrategy.getSplitMiddleThreshold |
expected: trait method get_split_middle_threshold(lower_bead_count) present
and consumed by RedistributeBeadingStrategy optimal bead count
(BeadingStrategy.hpp:97) | got: method absent from BeadingStrategy trait
(beading/mod.rs); RedistributeBeadingStrategy delegates optimal_bead_count
to parent unchanged (redistribute.rs:31-37) | ref: BeadingStrategy.hpp:97`

### G20: `ExtrusionLine::simplify` missing intersection-distance gate (Algorithm)

**PnP status:** closed (packet 155-arachne-beading-simplify-parity) — `simplify_distance_gated` now tracks `previous_previous`, ports OrcaSlicer's `next_length2 > 4 * smallest_line_segment_squared` special case, `intersection_infinite`, the `dist_greater` gate, and the junction-replacement else-branch. The G20 RED test's parameters were changed (per AC-6) because the originals could not reach the gate. See `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` D-156.
(`Arachne/utils/ExtrusionLine.cpp:163-175`) calls a `dist_greater` predicate
that rejects removing a junction when the proposed intersection point lies
more than `smallest_line_segment_squared` from either the `previous` or
`current` neighbor, even when the segment length and height-2 tests would
otherwise allow removal. This guards against artifact "spikes" when two
near-coincident long segments create a far-away intersection.

**Rust:** `simplify_extrusion_line` (`crates/slicer-core/src/arachne/simplify.rs`)
tier-3 checks `seg_len_sq < smallest_line_segment_squared` and
`height_2 ≤ allowed_error_distance_squared` but does not compute or compare
the intersection distance to `previous`/`current`. The intersection gate is
entirely absent.

**Expected:** a near-colinear polyline whose two long segments cross at a
point far from either endpoint (e.g. a "Z" shape that happens to be
colinear) is preserved because the intersection lies too far from the
surviving neighbors.

**Current:** such a polyline is simplified away because only segment length
and per-step height are checked.

**Test:** `arachne_parity_simplify_intersection_distance_gate_present`

**Panic message:** `PARITY GAP: simplify intersection distance gate |
expected: ExtrusionLine::simplify rejects removal when the intersection of
(prev,curr) extended lines lies more than smallest_line_segment_squared
from either neighbor (ExtrusionLine.cpp:163-175) | got: simplify only checks
seg_len² and height_2; no intersection-distance predicate (simplify.rs) |

## Re-verified (NOT gaps — round-2 subagent claims stale or fabricated)

- `initial_layer_min_bead_width` IS consumed: `pipeline.rs:281-285`
  substitutes `initial_layer_min_output_width` for `min_output_width` when
  `is_initial_layer`, and `WideningBeadingStrategy` receives it via
  `with_initial_layer_min_bead_width`.
- `wall_transition_angle` IS consumed: `pipeline.rs:353` passes
  `beading_params.wall_transition_angle` into `filter_central` for
  transition-angle gating.
- `RedistributeBeadingStrategy` outer width: symmetric placement at
  `thickness/2` for `bead_count <= 2` (`redistribute.rs:122-134`) matches
  Orca's "symmetric when <2×outer".
- `LimitedBeadingStrategy` border zero-width sentinel: present
  (`limited.rs:130-142`), matching Orca's border bead width 0.
- ~~G18~~ — dropped: Orca junction has no `flow_factor`; PnP superset
  design decision, not a parity gap.
- ~~G19~~ — dropped: Orca default also returns `{}`, matching PnP.

## Round-3 fixture additions

File: `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/fixtures/arachne_parity/mod.rs`
(appended below the existing round-2 fixture block):

- `ex_polygons_concentric_islands_mm() -> Vec<ExPolygon>` (G12)
- `beading_stack_for_split_middle() -> Box<dyn BeadingStrategy>` (G15)
- `simplify_input_intersection_distance_gate() -> Vec<ExtrusionJunction>` (G20)

## Round-3 test categorization (for the implementing agent)

- **G12** (`arachne_parity_wall_region_order_odd_after_enclosing`,
  Algorithm): ordering assertion over `run_arachne_pipeline(...).flatten()`
  output. Fix = add a `get_region_order` pass between `buckets` flattening
  and emission.
- **G15** (`arachne_parity_beading_split_middle_threshold_exposed`, Data
  Model): TDD-red via missing trait method. Fix = add
  `fn get_split_middle_threshold(&self, lower_bead_count: usize) -> f64`
  to `BeadingStrategy` (with default returning
  `f64::INFINITY`/`self.optimal_width`, like the Orca default), override in
  `DistributedBeadingStrategy` to return
  `wall_split_middle_threshold * (lower_bead_count + 1)`, and have
  `RedistributeBeadingStrategy::optimal_bead_count` consult it.
- **G20** (`arachne_parity_simplify_intersection_distance_gate_present`,
  Algorithm): tier-3 needs a new branch computing the intersection of the
  extended `(prev, curr)` lines and rejecting removal when
  `distance(intersection, prev).squared_norm() >
  smallest_line_segment_squared` OR
  `distance(intersection, curr).squared_norm() > smallest_line_segment_squared`.

## Porting reminders for the fixing agent (additive)

- G12 lives entirely in the Rust pipeline; no WIT/manifest change.
- G15's `wall_split_middle_threshold` is an internal Arachne parameter
  (no registered PnP config key yet); plumb it through `BeadingFactoryParams`
  the same way `default_transition_length` and `transition_filter_dist` are
  reserved today.
- G20's intersection gate depends on the `(prev, curr)` neighbor
  coordinates, which are already available in the existing tier-3 branch of
  `simplify_line`; no new struct fields required.
