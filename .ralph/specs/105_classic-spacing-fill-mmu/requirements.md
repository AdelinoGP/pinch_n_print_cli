# Requirements: 105_classic-spacing-fill-mmu

## Packet Metadata

- Grouped task IDs:

- Packet status: `draft`
- Aggregate context cost: `M`

## Problem Statement

`classic-perimeters` and `variable-width-perimeters` currently emit walls with a single configurable `line_width` (not distinguishing outer from inner), with a constant inter-wall spacing that ignores OrcaSlicer's `ext_perimeter_spacing2 vs perimeter_spacing` distinction, no thin-wall detection, no gap-fill, no `wall_sequence` modes, and an MMU dedup mechanism (`external_contour` from P96) that union-traces the model perimeter once per painted object — diverging from OrcaSlicer's per-color outer-wall fragmentation. The four defects compound: incorrect spacing on multi-width prints, missing thin features, gap-filled by infill or left as voids, single-color MMU wall regardless of paint, and an unparsable single sequence of walls per region (no sandwich mode, no inner-first option).

This packet lands the entire wall-emission geometry stack in one coordinated change because the four workstreams touch the same `lib.rs` files (the perimeter modules), the same IR (`SlicedRegion`, `LoopType`, `ExtrusionRole`), and the same host-side surface (`paint_segmentation`). Splitting would require three sequential touches of the same files, each with its own compile-cycle and AC churn. The MMU foundation (T-P96-A0/B/C0/C1/C2) folds in because T-P96-C1/C2 modify the same per-cell wall-trace loop that the wall_sequence + thin-wall + gap-fill code paths rewrite — coupling at the LOC level, not just at the conceptual level. T-P96-A0 lands first as a doc-only investigation step so the tie-break rule for C0 is grounded in OrcaSlicer source rather than guessed.

## In Scope

- New `crates/slicer-helpers/src/flow.rs` exporting `pub fn line_width_to_spacing(width: f32, layer_height: f32, nozzle_diameter: f32) -> f32` and the related `flow_to_width` round-trip. Port the minimal subset of OrcaSlicer's `Flow::new_from_width_height` that the perimeter modules need.
- Extension to `crates/slicer-helpers/src/perimeter_utils.rs`: `pub fn wall_sequence_reorder(walls: &mut Vec<WallLoop>, mode: WallSequence, wall_tree: &[PolygonTreeNode])` implementing all three modes.
- Config-key registrations in both perimeter manifests + `docs/15_config_keys_reference.md`: `outer_wall_line_width`, `inner_wall_line_width`, `precise_outer_wall`, `wall_sequence`, `detect_thin_wall`, `gap_infill_speed`, `filter_out_gap_fill`.
- Deregister `wall_sequence` from `modules/core-modules/path-optimization-default/path-optimization-default.toml` (ADR-0011 migration).
- New IR variants in `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs`: `LoopType::GapFill`, `ExtrusionRole::GapFill`. Both enums declared `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Resurrect `SlicedRegion.bisector_edge_skip_mask: Vec<Vec<bool>>` IR field; bump `CURRENT_SLICE_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION` to `4.3.0`.
- WIT mirrors in `crates/slicer-schema/wit/deps/ir-types.wit` for the new IR additions.
- Host-side bisector-mask computation in `crates/slicer-core/src/algos/paint_segmentation/` — populates `bisector_edge_skip_mask` deterministically per the tie-break rule named in T-P96-A0.
- `classic-perimeters/src/lib.rs` consumes the spacing model, runs thin-wall detection, runs gap-fill emission, applies `wall_sequence_reorder`, skips bisector-masked edges during per-cell outer-wall trace, removes `external_contour` consumption.
- `arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs` (or `variable-width-perimeters` post-rename) mirrors classic.
- Downstream role-switching consumers gain a `GapFill` match arm: `modules/core-modules/part-cooling/src/lib.rs`, `modules/core-modules/machine-gcode-emit/src/lib.rs` (if it dispatches by role), the host GCodeEmit role priority table.
- New one-pager `docs/specs/orca-mmu-perimeter-investigation.md` from T-P96-A0.
- 6 new TDD files covering AC-1 through AC-6 + 3 negative cases.
- All Doc Impact Statement edits.

## Out of Scope

- `extra_perimeters` consumer (T-070/T-071) and `extra_perimeters_on_overhangs` (T-077) — Phase 7 work, lands in P106.
- Narrow-island `smaller_perimeter_line_width` handling (T-072/T-073) — Phase 7, P106.
- Non-planar wall emission (T-074b/c/d) — Phase 7, P106. The `surface_group` accessor it consumes lands in P104, not here.
- Seam-candidate quality (T-080/T-081/T-082/T-083) — Phase 8, P106.
- M1 verification harness, fixture recording, deviation closure (Phase 9) — P107.
- T-P96-A (reshape AC-22b assertion), T-P96-C3 (parity verification), T-P96-D (delete `external_contour` IR field), T-P96-F (re-baseline SHA + deviation entry) — Phase 9 cleanup, P107.
- T-P96-E (real Arachne MMU at boundary level) — M2 work.
- Rename of `arachne-perimeters` → `variable-width-perimeters` — separate workstream.

<!-- snippet: orca-delegation -->
## OrcaSlicer Reference Obligations

All OrcaSlicer reads MUST be delegated to a sub-agent. Never load `OrcaSlicerDocumented/` into the implementer's own context. Dispatch contract: return `LOCATIONS` (file:line + 1-line context, ≤ 20 entries) or `SUMMARY` (≤ 200 words, no code unless asked). Code snippets in returns are capped at 30 lines.

Files to inspect for this packet:

- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/PerimeterGenerator.cpp:1501-1506,1644` — `ext_perimeter_spacing2`/`perimeter_spacing` + `precise_outer_wall` gating. SUMMARY ≤ 150 words.
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/PerimeterGenerator.cpp:1596-1609` — thin-wall cascade. SUMMARY ≤ 150 words.
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/PerimeterGenerator.cpp:1665-1670,1930-1958` — gap collection + emission. SUMMARY ≤ 150 words.
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/PerimeterGenerator.cpp:1801-1913` — `wall_sequence` reorder including `InnerOuterInner` sandwich. SUMMARY ≤ 200 words.
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/Flow.cpp` — `Flow::new_from_width_height` math. SUMMARY ≤ 100 words.
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/MultiMaterialSegmentation.cpp` and `PerimeterGenerator.cpp` per-color branches — MMU per-color outer-wall fragmentation + bisector tie-break rule. SUMMARY ≤ 200 words. **This is the deliverable of T-P96-A0** — the implementer dispatches this SUMMARY and writes `docs/specs/orca-mmu-perimeter-investigation.md` from it.

## Acceptance Summary

- Positive cases: `AC-1` (outer/inner widths + spacing arithmetic), `AC-2` (three wall_sequence modes), `AC-3` (ThinWall emission), `AC-4` (GapFill emission), `AC-5` (bisector_edge_skip_mask field + host populator + 4.3.0 bump), `AC-6` (MMU per-color fragmentation end-to-end).
- Negative cases: `AC-N1` (thin-wall config off → no ThinWall), `AC-N2` (no gaps → no GapFill, no panic), `AC-N3` (single-color → mask all-false, unchanged baseline).
- Refinements not captured in Given/When/Then:
  - `wall_sequence_reorder`'s `InnerOuterInner` per-outer-contour grouping uses the in-module wall tree built during generation; the tree is discarded before commit (per ADR-0011 — IR stays flat).
  - `bisector_edge_skip_mask` outer Vec aligns with `polygons[i]`; inner Vec[j] aligns with edge `(polygons[i].contour.points[j], polygons[i].contour.points[(j+1) % len])`. Documented in `slice_ir.rs` doc-comment.
  - `external_contour` IR field is **NOT** deleted by this packet — that's T-P96-D, deferred to P107. Both modules' code paths just stop consuming it.
- Cross-packet impact: depends on P102 + P103 (must ship first). Unblocks P106 (special modes + seam) and P107 (verification + closure).

## Step Completion Expectations

- Cross-step invariant: existing `boundary_paint_tdd.rs` and `arachne_perimeters_tdd.rs` regression tests in both perimeter modules MUST stay green at every step. The thin-wall and gap-fill code paths add new `walls` entries — they must not regress existing single-color extrusion shapes.
- Step ordering rationale: T-P96-A0 investigation first (Step 1) because its tie-break finding is consumed by T-P96-C0's host populator. IR additions (Step 2) before host populator (Step 3) because the populator writes the new field. Module-side spacing model (Step 4) before module-side wall_sequence (Step 5) because the sandwich reorder operates on the tree the spacing model builds. Thin-walls + gap-fill (Step 6) before MMU module consumption (Step 7) because both Step 6 and Step 7 modify the per-cell trace loop, and Step 7's bisector skip layer goes outermost; doing them in the opposite order requires re-touching Step 6's edits.
- Shared scratch state: none.

## Context Discipline Notes

- This packet has 7 implementation steps and ~19 tasks. Per-step file edit count is held to ≤ 3 throughout. The implementer must keep each step independently committable — do NOT batch two steps' edits into one commit even if "they're related".
- `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs` is ~1700 lines — range-read by `rg -n 'LoopType\|ExtrusionRole\|SlicedRegion\|CURRENT_SLICE_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION'` then ±40 lines.
- `crates/slicer-core/src/algos/paint_segmentation/` is a directory — `wc -l` each file before reading; range-read the `voronoi_graph` or analogous file by `rg -n 'bisector|cell_neighbor'` and load only the relevant chunk.
- Both perimeter modules' `lib.rs` files post-P102/P103/P104 state will be ~600-800 LOC each. Range-read `run_perimeters` body and the per-cell wall-trace loop only. Loading the whole file each step is forbidden.
- Likely temptation read: the existing `arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs` ray-cast logic. Skip — that logic was promoted to `slicer-helpers::geometry` in P103.
- Sub-agent return-format for the heaviest dispatch: OrcaSlicer `wall_sequence` SUMMARY (≤ 200 words) is the longest contract; the sandwich mode is structurally complex and the SUMMARY MUST describe the per-outer-contour grouping and the inset-index reordering rule without code. Re-dispatch if the return includes implementation pseudocode.
