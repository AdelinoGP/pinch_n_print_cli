# Requirements: 112_arachne-extrusion-and-wireup

## Packet Metadata

- Grouped task IDs:
  - `T-220` — Port centrality filtering (`filterCentral`, `filterNoncentralRegions`).
  - `T-221` — Bead-count assignment on central edges (`optimal_bead_count(R)` per edge).
  - `T-222` — Port bead-count upward + downward propagation (`propagateBeadingsUpward`, `propagateBeadingsDownward`) — marks `TransitionMiddle` / `TransitionEnd`.
  - `T-223` — Port `generateToolpaths()` — emits `Vec<VariableWidthLines>` (sorted by `inset_idx`).
  - `T-224` — Define `ExtrusionLine` + `ExtrusionJunction` IR types; `Point3WithWidth` round-trips via converter.
  - `T-225` — Port `stitch_extrusions` (join open polylines within `bead_width_x - 1nm`).
  - `T-226` — Port `simplifyToolPaths` (DP simplification per `ExtrusionLine`).
  - `T-227` — Port `removeSmallLines` (drop odd, non-closed lines shorter than `min_length_factor * min_width`).
  - `T-230` — Wire `slicer-core::{arachne, beading, skeletal_trapezoidation}` into `arachne-perimeters::run_perimeters`. Module produces WallLoops with per-junction width; pre-processing + SKT + beading + extrusion-gen runs end-to-end on golden fixture.
  - `T-231` — Extend parity harness (P109 / T-100) with 4 Arachne fixtures: tapered wedge, narrow strip with widening, max-bead-count cap, complex multi-feature polygon. Plus cube_4color Arachne extension via T-P96-E preprocessing.
  - `T-232` — Walk every M2 deviation entry from T-003 update; close or justify.
  - `T-233` — Update `docs/01_system_architecture.md` Tier-2 `Layer::Perimeters` to name the real Arachne pipeline (Voronoi + SkeletalTrapezoidation + BeadingStrategy). NOTE: there is no "iterative-inset approximation" caveat in the doc today (P108 already left it clean) — this is a positive naming update, not a removal.
  - `T-234` — Final full-suite run via the gated entry point `cargo xtask test --workspace` (closure-ceremony, CLAUDE.md §"Test Discipline" workspace-test exception; the gate fires the guest-WASM freshness check first).
- Backlog source: `docs/specs/perimeter-modules-orca-parity-roadmap.md`
- Packet status: `draft`
- Aggregate context cost: `M`

## Problem Statement

**FORWARD-DEP BLOCKERS (the two remaining are `draft` sibling M2 packets P110 + P111; the M1 predecessors P105 + P109 have shipped):**
- **FORWARD-DEP on P110 (`draft` — sibling M2 packet):** `SkeletalTrapezoidationGraph`, `voronoi_from_segments`, `arachne/preprocess.rs` (`preprocess_input_outline`, `preprocess_per_color_inputs`), and the NEW `arachne-perimeters` skeleton (empty `LayerModule` impl + `warn!`) do NOT exist in the tree yet. Steps 1–9 assume these symbols will be produced by P110. If P110 is not `status: implemented` at activation time, this packet cannot activate. NOTE: the old 512-line iterative-inset fake was DELETED by P108; P110 creates the fresh skeleton.
- **FORWARD-DEP on P111 (`draft` — sibling M2 packet):** `BeadingStrategy` trait, `BeadingStrategyFactory`, `BeadingFactoryParams`, and `crates/slicer-core/src/beading/` do NOT exist in the tree yet. Step 2 (bead-count assignment) and Step 9 (wire-up) assume these symbols. If P111 is not `status: implemented` at activation time, this packet cannot activate.
- **P109 (`implemented`):** The `perimeter_parity.rs` harness (`crates/slicer-runtime/tests/integration/perimeter_parity.rs`) and the `cube_4color` fixtures from P109's T-100 are PRESENT and green. Step 10 (T-231 fixtures) extends this harness.
- **P105 (`implemented`):** `LoopType::GapFill` (and `ExtrusionRole::GapFill`) ALREADY exist — P105/T-062b added them additively at schema 4.4.0, both `#[non_exhaustive]`. Gap-fill loops may be emitted directly; there is no longer a forward-dep here.

P110 will ship the foundations (Voronoi wrapper, SkeletalTrapezoidationGraph, parabolic discretization, 9-stage preprocess, per-color MMU dedup, NEW `arachne-perimeters` skeleton with empty `run_perimeters` returning `Ok(())` + `warn!`). P111 will ship the BeadingStrategy stack (trait, 5 strategies, factory, 11 config keys, D-9 strip-pass). P112 closes the loop: extrusion generation reads the SKT graph's centrality marks + per-edge bead counts + propagated transitions and emits `Vec<VariableWidthLines>`; stitch + simplify + removeSmall clean the output; `arachne-perimeters::run_perimeters` is IMPLEMENTED in the P110-created empty skeleton with the real Voronoi/beading-based path. NOTE: the old 512-line iterative-inset fake was DELETED by P108/T-090. At P112 activation the skeleton contains only the `warn!` stub — filling it is T-230's job.

T-224 adds `ExtrusionLine` + `ExtrusionJunction` IR types. These are NEW additions (additive schema change); the bump is minor-version. **Schema version computed at activation:** live `CURRENT_SLICE_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION` = `4.6.0` (`crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs:213`; P105 already bumped to 4.4.0 for the `GapFill` variants, and later M1 work carried it to 4.6.0), so the target is `4.7.0`. At activation, the implementer MUST re-read the actual constant value and increment the minor version by 1 — do NOT assume `4.7.0` if a parallel branch bumps first. Both types use `#[serde(default)]` on any new optional fields for round-trip safety with pre-bump fixtures.

T-231 extends P109's parity harness with 4 Arachne-specific fixtures (tapered wedge tests variable widths; narrow strip with widening tests the Widening strategy; max-bead-count cap tests the Limited strategy; complex multi-feature polygon tests the whole SKT graph end-to-end). It also extends the cube_4color test from P109 to assert Arachne produces per-color fragmented walls — this is the M2 half of T-P96-E (M1 half landed in P105 via Classic; the per-color preprocessing from P110 + this packet's wire-up makes Arachne ship the same parity behavior).

T-232 (deviation walk) closes D-7 (boostvoronoi selection — via ADR-0023 in P110), D-9 (sentinel strip — via T-215b in P111), and D-15 (Arachne MMU path — via investigation in P105). **IMPORTANT:** D-7, D-9, and D-15 live in `docs/specs/perimeter-modules-orca-parity-roadmap.md` (the roadmap), NOT in `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md`. AC-11's closure grep MUST target the roadmap file for these three IDs. Any new deviations registered during M2 work that are added to `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` must use the live `D-<pkt>-<SLUG>` format observed in that file. Any new deviations registered during M2 work get closure entries or justified-residual status.

T-233 (architecture doc) updates the Tier-2 `Layer::Perimeters` box: the current text is a bare "Wall generation (Arachne variable-width or classic fixed-width)" label (line ~267) — there is no "iterative-inset" caveat left to remove (P108 already cleaned it). With real Arachne shipping, the box gains an explicit "real Arachne (Voronoi + SkeletalTrapezoidation + BeadingStrategy stack)" description citing P112.

T-234 (closure ceremony) runs the full suite via the gated entry point `cargo xtask test --workspace` (which fires the guest-WASM freshness check before the suite — this packet rebuilds the `arachne-perimeters` guest). This is the workspace-test exception per CLAUDE.md — every prior verification in P112 was narrow (per-crate or per-test); the closure ceremony is the gate that catches cross-cutting regressions in M1 modules that M2 wire-up might have introduced.

## In Scope

- `crates/slicer-core/src/skeletal_trapezoidation/centrality.rs` (NEW) — T-220.
- `crates/slicer-core/src/skeletal_trapezoidation/bead_count.rs` (NEW) — T-221.
- `crates/slicer-core/src/skeletal_trapezoidation/propagation.rs` (NEW) — T-222.
- `crates/slicer-core/src/arachne/generate_toolpaths.rs` (NEW) — T-223.

- `crates/slicer-core/tests/{centrality.rs, bead_count.rs, propagation.rs, generate_toolpaths.rs, stitch.rs, simplify.rs, remove_small.rs}` + fixtures (NEW).
- `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs` (EDIT) — add `ExtrusionLine` + `ExtrusionJunction` types; bump `CURRENT_SLICE_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION` minor version.
- `crates/slicer-schema/wit/deps/ir-types.wit` (EDIT) — declare `extrusion-line` and `extrusion-junction` records.
- `crates/slicer-wasm-host/src/host.rs` (EDIT) — populate new fields for guest reads if needed.
- `crates/slicer-sdk/src/views.rs` (EDIT) — expose `extrusion_line` accessor if used by other modules (likely deferred to a follow-on; this packet's `arachne-perimeters` builds the lines internally and converts to `Point3WithWidth` for the existing WallLoop surface).
- `modules/core-modules/arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs` (EDIT) — implement `run_perimeters` in the P110-created empty skeleton with the real SKT/beading-based wire-up. The old 512-line iterative-inset fake (`generate_arachne_walls`) was DELETED by P108; the skeleton from P110 contains only a `warn!` stub at P112 activation.
- `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/fixtures/perimeter_parity/{tapered_wedge,narrow_strip_widening,max_bead_count_cap,complex_multi_feature,cube_4color_arachne}/` (NEW) — 4 Arachne fixtures + cube_4color Arachne reference.
- `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/integration/perimeter_parity.rs` (EDIT) — extend harness if comparators need Arachne-specific tolerances; add Arachne suite entry.
- `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/executor/arachne_perimeters_simple_square.rs` (NEW) — AC-9 standalone test.
- `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` (EDIT) — close D-7/D-9/D-15 + any new M2 entries.
- `docs/01_system_architecture.md` (EDIT) — Tier-2 caveat removal + real-Arachne line.
- `docs/02_ir_schemas.md` (EDIT) — `ExtrusionLine`/`ExtrusionJunction` entries + version bump rationale.
- `docs/07_implementation_status.md` (EDIT) — M2 complete entry.
- `docs/specs/perimeter-modules-orca-parity-roadmap.md` (EDIT) — flip T-220..T-234 + M2 marker to DONE.

## Out of Scope

- Arachne-specific config keys beyond those registered in P111 (`m_params.*`) — any newly discovered config keys ship in a follow-on packet.
- Performance optimization of the Arachne pipeline — wall-clock measurement isn't gated.
- Multi-region Arachne edge cases beyond the 4 fixtures + cube_4color — additional fixtures ship in audit follow-ons.
- Spiral-vase + non-planar — orthogonal sibling roadmaps (per D-3, D-11).
- Overhang pipeline restructuring — closed by P106/P107 in M1.
- Classic-perimeters edits — M1 frozen.

<!-- snippet: orca-delegation -->
## OrcaSlicer Reference Obligations

All OrcaSlicer reads MUST be delegated to a sub-agent. Never load `OrcaSlicerDocumented/` into the implementer's own context. Dispatch contract: return `LOCATIONS` (file:line + 1-line context, ≤ 20 entries) or `SUMMARY` (≤ 200 words, no code unless asked).

Files to inspect for this packet — ONE dispatch per function/file:

| File / Function | Dispatch | Return ≤ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Arachne/SkeletalTrapezoidation.cpp::filterCentral` + `filterNoncentralRegions` | SUMMARY | 200 words — centrality predicate + filter loop body |
| `Arachne/SkeletalTrapezoidation.cpp::optimal_bead_count` call site + R-derivation | SUMMARY | 100 words — how `r_min`/`r_max`/`r_avg` map to `optimal_bead_count` input |
| `Arachne/SkeletalTrapezoidation.cpp::propagateBeadingsUpward / Downward` | SUMMARY | 200 words — propagation pass body + TransitionMiddle/End marker rule |
| `Arachne/SkeletalTrapezoidation.cpp::generateToolpaths` | SUMMARY | 200 words — `Vec<VariableWidthLines>` emission + inset_idx sort |
| `Arachne/WallToolPaths.cpp::stitch_extrusions` | SUMMARY | 150 words — gap-join rule + primary preservation |
| `Arachne/WallToolPaths.cpp::simplifyToolPaths` | SUMMARY | 100 words — DP epsilon |
| `Arachne/WallToolPaths.cpp::removeSmallLines` | SUMMARY | 100 words — removal rule + primary invariant |
| `libslic3r/ExtrusionEntity.h` (`ExtrusionLine`, `ExtrusionJunction`) | LOCATIONS | 10 entries — struct fields + invariants |

For T-231's 4 Arachne fixtures: ONE SUMMARY per fixture (≤ 100 words each) — describe expected `PerimeterIR` shape (wall count, role distribution, per-junction width). 4 dispatches total. The recorded fixtures are JSON files derived from these expectations.

For T-231's cube_4color Arachne extension: NO direct OrcaSlicer read needed. Use `docs/specs/orca-mmu-perimeter-investigation.md` (P105/T-P96-A0 one-pager) as the authoritative source.

## Acceptance Summary

- Positive cases: `AC-1` (centrality 3 fixtures), `AC-2` (bead_count tapered_wedge), `AC-3` (propagation 3 fixtures), `AC-4` (generateToolpaths tapered_wedge), `AC-5` (ExtrusionLine round-trip + schema bump), `AC-6` (stitch primary preservation), `AC-7` (simplify vertex count), `AC-8` (removeSmall primary preservation), `AC-9` (arachne-perimeters real wire-up simple-square), `AC-10` (4 Arachne parity fixtures green), `AC-11` (M2 deviations closed), `AC-12` (architecture doc updated), `AC-13` (workspace test ceremony green).
- Negative cases: `AC-N1` (bead_count requires centrality), `AC-N2` (ExtrusionLine pre-bump JSON deserializes), `AC-N3` (removeSmall all-primary invariant).
- Refinements not captured in Given/When/Then:
  - The schema-version bump in AC-5 is additive (`#[serde(default)]` on new optional fields). Live value at refinement = `4.6.0` (P105/P106/P109 shipped; P105 carried it to 4.4.0 for `GapFill`). Implementer re-reads the actual constant at activation and bumps minor by 1 (→ `4.7.0`).
  - The cube_4color Arachne extension fixture under T-231 reuses `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/fixtures/perimeter_parity/cube_4color_orca.gcode` (recorded by P109 / T-P96-C3) — Arachne wired against this fixture MUST produce the same parity result, validating the per-color preprocessing chain from P110 + this packet's wire-up.
  - T-234 (workspace ceremony) is dispatched to a sub-agent per CLAUDE.md (`FACT pass/fail` return). The implementer does NOT absorb the full output.

## Step Completion Expectations

- Cross-step invariant: every prior M1 + M2 packet's regression tests must stay green throughout. If a prior test fails after the `arachne-perimeters::run_perimeters` real wire-up, it's a signal that the new module's claims (perimeter-generator) collide with another module's claims; the DAG validation from P110's AC-N2 should catch this — investigate before patching.
- Step ordering rationale: extrusion-generation primitives (Steps 1–7) → IR types (Step 8 — additive change, no break) → real wire-up (Step 9 — replaces placeholder) → parity fixtures (Step 10 — depends on wire-up to slice meaningful output) → deviation walk + docs (Step 11) → workspace ceremony (Step 12 — final gate).
- Shared scratch state: the 4 Arachne parity JSON fixtures + cube_4color Arachne reference are written once in Step 10. Subsequent steps must not edit them. If Step 11 or Step 12 reveals a regression that would make a fixture stale, the implementer halts and traces the regression (do NOT just re-record).
- T-234 (workspace ceremony) MUST be the last step. If it fails, the closure log records the failure mode and the packet stays in-progress; the implementer does NOT flip status to `implemented` until the suite is green.

## Context Discipline Notes

- This packet has 12 steps — the heaviest M2 packet. The largest is Step 9 (real wire-up + the arachne_perimeters_simple_square test).
- `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs` is ~1700 LOC — range-read by `rg -n 'ExtrusionLine\|ExtrusionJunction\|Point3WithWidth\|CURRENT_SLICE_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION'`.
- `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/integration/perimeter_parity.rs` (from P109) — read full at Step 10 to extend; the file is small (≤ 200 LOC at P109 close).
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/Arachne/SkeletalTrapezoidation.cpp` (~3000 LOC) — multiple SUMMARY dispatches across Steps 1–4. Each capped at 200 words.
- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/Arachne/WallToolPaths.cpp` (~2500 LOC) — SUMMARY dispatches at Steps 5–7. Each capped at 150 words.
- Likely temptation: re-read OrcaSlicer source to disambiguate generateToolpaths edge cases. **Use the SUMMARY dispatch + the recorded golden fixtures** — the goldens are the source of truth for parity. If a function can't make a golden green after 2 attempts, re-dispatch a tighter SUMMARY for that specific edge case.
- Sub-agent return-format for the heaviest dispatch: `generateToolpaths` SUMMARY MUST be ≤ 200 words. If it returns > 250, re-dispatch tighter focused on the inset-emission loop body.
- T-234 (workspace ceremony) MUST be dispatched. The implementer does NOT absorb >200 lines of cargo output — sub-agent returns FACT pass/fail + summary line + count.
