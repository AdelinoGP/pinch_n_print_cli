# Design: 104_perimeter-propagation-and-surface-rules

## Controlling Code Paths

- Primary code path: `SliceRegionView` (SDK) → `build_wall_flags` (shared utils, renamed+extended from `build_outer_wall_flags`) → per-vertex `WallFeatureFlags` writes inside `run_perimeters` (both modules). Two new config gates (`only_one_wall_top`, `only_one_wall_first_layer`) read in `run_perimeters` to override the effective `wall_count`.
- Neighboring tests / fixtures: 5 new TDD files under `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/contract/` and `crates/slicer-core/tests/`, plus 1 new `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/contract/inner_wall_boundary_type_tdd.rs`. Existing `boundary_paint_tdd.rs` regression coverage in both modules must stay green.
- OrcaSlicer comparison surface: see `requirements.md` §OrcaSlicer Reference Obligations (delegate; never load).

## Architecture Constraints

<!-- snippet: wasm-staleness -->
- Guest WASM is **not** rebuilt by `cargo build` or `cargo test`. After editing any path in this packet's change surface that feeds the guest build (see `CLAUDE.md` §"Guest WASM Staleness"), the implementer MUST run `cargo xtask build-guests --check` and, if `STALE:` is reported, rebuild without `--check` before re-running the failing test. Stale-guest failures look unrelated to the change but are caused by it.

<!-- snippet: coord-system -->
- Coordinate units: **1 unit = 100 nm** (10⁻⁴ mm), NOT 1 nm like OrcaSlicer. Divide OrcaSlicer constants by 100. Use `Point2::from_mm(x, y)` or `mm_to_units()` at every mm↔unit boundary. Full porting checklist in `docs/08_coordinate_system.md`.

- View-accessor convention: `overhang_areas()` and `surface_group()` follow the existing `bridge_areas()` / `has_nonplanar()` pattern — pre-filtered per-region at view construction; the guest receives only data relevant to the current region. No raw `SurfaceClassificationIR` access from guest space. Note: the existing non-planar accessor is `has_nonplanar() -> bool`, NOT `nonplanar_surface()`.
- `T-024` deferral invariant: `Point3WithWidth.overhang_quartile` MUST be set to `None` in every emit path (NOT left at field default, NOT inherited from caller). The doc-comment cites the sibling roadmap.
- Per-layer config rule (carries over from packet 102, T-015): `only_one_wall_top` and `only_one_wall_first_layer` MUST be read from `_config.get_bool` per `run_perimeters` invocation, not cached at `on_print_start`. Per-layer overrides take effect.
- `only_one_wall_top` parity scope: fires for `top_shell_index() == Some(0)` (blanket top-shell gate) AND for `Some(N>0)` sub-top shells via the `split_top_surfaces` carve against `top_solid_fill` (implemented this session); `None` is a no-op.

## Code Change Surface

- Selected approach: add the two view accessors with **host-side pre-filtering**. For `overhang_areas()`: the field `OverhangRegion.xy_footprint: Vec<ExPolygon>` is **net-new (added by P106/O-T010)** and is absent from the current tree (`OverhangRegion` at `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs:586` is `{ id, facet_indices, max_angle_deg, needs_support }`). This packet's populator therefore returns `Vec::new()` and does **not** reference the not-yet-existent field — the `xy_footprint`-intersection body is wired by P106/consumers once the field lands. (`BridgeRegion.xy_footprint` at `slice_ir.rs:581` is the analogous field that *does* exist today and serves as the shape template.) For `surface_group()`: the host resolves `nonplanar_surface: Option<SurfaceGroupId>` (at `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs:1233`) to `Option<&SurfaceGroup>` by lookup in `SurfaceClassificationIR.per_object[…].surface_groups`. Both accessors return `&[ExPolygon]` / `Option<&SurfaceGroup>` view references — no Vec cloning.

  `build_outer_wall_flags` (at `crates/slicer-core/src/perimeter_utils.rs:30`) is RENAMED to `build_wall_flags` and gains an `is_outer: bool` parameter; the existing outer-wall logic moves under `if is_outer` and a new inner-wall code path runs the same Material / FuzzySkin extraction logic against the inner polygon. Signature: `pub fn build_wall_flags(num_points: usize, poly_idx: usize, segment_annotations: &HashMap<PaintSemantic, Vec<Vec<Option<PaintValue>>>>, is_outer: bool) -> (Vec<WallFeatureFlags>, WallBoundaryType)`. Per-vertex `is_bridge` derivation runs once per wall vertex via a point-in-polygon helper against `region.bridge_areas()`. `only_one_wall_top` and `only_one_wall_first_layer` are checked at the head of `run_perimeters`'s wall-emission loop; when either fires, `wall_count` is locally clamped to 1 before the loop iterates.

  WIT side: Step 1 defines a NEW `surface-group` record and `type surface-group-id = u64` in `ir-types.wit` (~20 LOC); then adds the two `func()` declarations to `slice-region-view`. The existing `surface-group-proposal` in `world-prepass.wit` is a write-side PrePass type — it is smaller (4 fields) and MUST NOT be reused as the read-side `surface-group` record.

- Exact functions, traits, manifests, tests, or fixtures expected to change:
  - `crates/slicer-sdk/src/views.rs` — add `pub fn overhang_areas`, `pub fn surface_group`; add the corresponding fields on `SliceRegionView` struct.
  - `crates/slicer-schema/wit/deps/ir-types.wit` — define `surface-group-id` type + `surface-group` record (7 fields); add `overhang-areas` and `surface-group` func() to `slice-region-view`.
  - `crates/slicer-wasm-host/src/host.rs` — `SliceRegionData` field additions; populator fills `surface_group` from `SurfaceClassificationIR` and `overhang_areas` to `Vec::new()` (net-new `OverhangRegion.xy_footprint` is absent until P106) at view-construction.
  - `crates/slicer-core/src/perimeter_utils.rs` — rename `build_outer_wall_flags` → `build_wall_flags`, add `is_outer: bool` parameter and inner-wall code path; add `pub fn point_in_any_polygon(pt: &Point2, polys: &[ExPolygon]) -> bool` helper.
  - `modules/core-modules/classic-perimeters/src/lib.rs` — call `build_wall_flags(.., is_outer=false)` for inner walls; read `region.bridge_areas()` for `is_bridge` per-vertex; read `_config.get_bool("only_one_wall_top")` and `_config.get_bool("only_one_wall_first_layer")`. Classic has **no** inline `Point3WithWidth` literal — its per-vertex vertices flow through the shared `expolygon_to_path3d` helper (which already carries `overhang_quartile: None`/`flow_factor: 1.0`; the T-024 doc-comment lands at the helper in Step 2). Note: `Point3WithWidth` has `flow_factor: f32` and `overhang_quartile: Option<u8>` — NOT `is_bridge`/`tool_index`; those live on `WallFeatureFlags`.
  - `modules/core-modules/arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs` — same inner-wall/bridge/config wiring as classic, PLUS its inline `Point3WithWidth { … overhang_quartile: None, flow_factor: 1.0 }` (variable-width path, lib.rs:428) gets the sibling-roadmap O-T031 doc-comment for AC-6's arachne grep.
  - `modules/core-modules/{classic,arachne}-perimeters/*.toml` — register the two new config keys.
  - `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/contract/main.rs` — add `mod per_vertex_is_bridge_propagation_tdd;`, `mod only_one_wall_top_tdd;`, `mod only_one_wall_first_layer_tdd;`, `mod inner_wall_boundary_type_tdd;` (required for test files to compile; no auto-discovery).
  - 7 new TDD files (5 base + 1 contract for AC-2b + 1 contract for AC-3-EMPTY).
  - 3 docs per Doc Impact Statement.
- Rejected alternatives that were considered and why they were not chosen:
  - Separate `SurfaceClassificationView` parameter to `run_perimeters` (option (b) of D-4): rejected per the grilling D-4 closure — view churn for one consumer.
  - Compute `overhang_areas` on-demand inside the perimeter module: rejected — pushes mesh-cross-section work into Tier 2 parallel layers, which is forbidden by Tier 1/Tier 2 separation. Host pre-filters at view construction.
  - Cache `only_one_wall_top` / `only_one_wall_first_layer` at `on_print_start`: rejected — defeats per-layer config override (T-015 invariant).
  - Reuse `surface-group-proposal` WIT record: rejected — different field set (4 vs 7); it is a PrePass write type, not a read-side IR type.

## Files in Scope (read + edit)

Primary edit surface exceeds 3 files; the packet bundles 10 roadmap tasks per the user's directive. The **three highest-LOC-delta** files are listed first:

- `crates/slicer-core/src/perimeter_utils.rs` — role: rename `build_outer_wall_flags` → `build_wall_flags`, add `is_outer` parameter + `point_in_any_polygon` helper; expected change: ~80 LOC.
- `modules/core-modules/classic-perimeters/src/lib.rs` — role: consume new view accessors, read bridge_areas per-vertex, gate wall_count on the two new flags; expected change: ~60 LOC.
- `modules/core-modules/arachne-perimeters/src/lib.rs` — role: mirror of classic; expected change: ~60 LOC.
- `crates/slicer-sdk/src/views.rs` — role: two new accessors + struct fields; expected change: ~30 LOC.
- `crates/slicer-wasm-host/src/host.rs` — role: populator fills new fields; expected change: ~20 LOC.
- `crates/slicer-schema/wit/deps/ir-types.wit` — role: define `surface-group` record + add WIT funcs; expected change: ~20 LOC.
- `modules/core-modules/{classic,arachne}-perimeters/*.toml` — role: register two config keys; expected change: ~10 LOC each.
- `crates/slicer-runtime/tests/contract/main.rs` — role: register 4 new `mod` entries; expected change: ~4 LOC.
- 7 new TDD files (incl. `overhang_areas_empty_until_p106_tdd.rs` for AC-3-EMPTY).
- 3 doc files per Doc Impact Statement.

## Read-Only Context

- `docs/specs/overhang-pipeline-restructuring.md` — read full (~150 lines) — purpose: confirm AC-3 accessor signature matches sibling-roadmap O-T030 plan + understand the T-024 deferral context.
- `docs/specs/perimeter-modules-orca-parity-roadmap.md` — range-read §"Phase 2" and §"Phase 3" only — purpose: scope confirmation per task.
- `docs/02_ir_schemas.md` — delegate SUMMARY for `SurfaceClassificationIR`, `BridgeRegion`, `OverhangRegion`, `SurfaceGroup` — purpose: confirm field shapes the host populator reads.
- `docs/05_module_sdk.md` — delegate SUMMARY for `SliceRegionView` accessor + WIT convention — purpose: align new accessor style.
- `docs/15_config_keys_reference.md` — read full — purpose: confirm no "Walls" section exists; match the creation format.
- `modules/core-modules/classic-perimeters/tests/boundary_paint_tdd.rs` — read — purpose: confirm regression coverage; do not edit.
- `modules/core-modules/arachne-perimeters/tests/boundary_paint_tdd.rs` — read — same as classic.

## Out-of-Bounds Files

- `OrcaSlicerDocumented/**` — delegate parity checks; never load.
- `target/`, `Cargo.lock`, generated bindgen output — never load.
- Vendored deps — never load.
- `crates/slicer-core/src/algos/mesh_analysis.rs` — out of scope. The sibling roadmap (overhang-pipeline-restructuring O-T010 / P106) edits this file AND adds the net-new `OverhangRegion.xy_footprint` field; this packet's `overhang_areas()` accessor returns `Vec::new()` and does NOT read that field (which is absent from the current tree — `BridgeRegion.xy_footprint` at `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs:581` is a different, existing field). When P106 adds and populates `OverhangRegion.xy_footprint`, the intersection body is wired then.
- `crates/slicer-core/src/algos/prepass_slice.rs` — out of scope.
- `crates/slicer-runtime/src/region_partition.rs` — out of scope.
- All `slicer-core` files except `perimeter_utils.rs` — out of scope.
- All modules under `modules/core-modules/` except the two perimeter modules — out of scope.

## Expected Sub-Agent Dispatches

- "Summarize `OrcaSlicerDocumented/src/libslic3r/PerimeterGenerator.cpp:1574-1577,1715` for `only_one_wall_top` and `only_one_wall_first_layer` gating; return SUMMARY ≤ 100 words" — purpose: Step 4 gate-logic confirmation.
- "Summarize `docs/02_ir_schemas.md` for the `SurfaceGroup` struct shape and the host populator pattern for `bridge_areas`; return SUMMARY ≤ 150 words" — purpose: Step 1 view-accessor + host-populator template.
- "Run `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` after each step; return FACT pass/fail + SNIPPETS ≤ 20 lines on fail" — purpose: cross-crate compile gate.
- "Run `cargo test -p slicer-runtime --test contract per_vertex_is_bridge_propagation_tdd`; return FACT pass/fail + assertion text on fail" — purpose: AC-1 verification.
- "Run `cargo test -p slicer-core --test inner_wall_material_boundary_tdd`; return FACT pass/fail" — purpose: AC-2.
- "Run `cargo test -p slicer-runtime --test contract inner_wall_boundary_type_tdd`; return FACT pass/fail" — purpose: AC-2b.
- "Run `cargo test -p slicer-runtime --test contract only_one_wall_top_tdd only_one_wall_first_layer_tdd`; return FACT pass/fail per test" — purpose: AC-4 + AC-5.
- "Run `cargo xtask build-guests --check`; return FACT (clean / STALE list ≤ 5 entries)" — purpose: Step 1 closure gate after WIT change.

## Data and Contract Notes

- IR or manifest contracts touched: `SliceRegionView` gains two read-only accessors. WIT side gains a new `surface-group` record definition, a `surface-group-id` type alias, and two `func()` declarations on `slice-region-view`. `SliceRegionData` (host-side mirror) gains two fields. No IR-side struct shape changes — `Point3WithWidth` already has `flow_factor: f32` and `overhang_quartile: Option<u8>` (confirmed at `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs:1503`). `WallFeatureFlags` has `tool_index: Option<u32>`, `fuzzy_skin: bool`, `is_bridge: bool`, `is_thin_wall: bool`, `skip_ironing: bool`, `custom: HashMap<String, PaintValue>` (confirmed at `crates/slicer-ir/src/slice_ir.rs:1479`). `Point3WithWidth` does NOT have `is_bridge` or `tool_index` fields.
- WIT boundary considerations: per CLAUDE.md WIT/Type Changes Checklist, `cargo build --tests` must pass after the WIT edit before Step 1 closes. The WIT `surface-group` record is NEW — it does not exist in `ir-types.wit` yet (only `surface-group-proposal` in `world-prepass.wit`, which is a different type).
- Determinism or scheduler constraints: none. The per-vertex propagation is deterministic (point-in-polygon is a pure function over its inputs); the two wall-count gates are deterministic conditionals.
- `T-024` deferral contract: every emit path that constructs a `Point3WithWidth` MUST set `overhang_quartile: None`. The doc-comment cites `docs/specs/overhang-pipeline-restructuring.md` O-T031 as the future producer. When the sibling roadmap lands, T-024's full implementation is a small follow-up packet that flips this `None` to a point-in-quartile-polygon test.

## Locked Assumptions and Invariants

- `is_bridge` semantics: a wall vertex is `is_bridge: true` if and only if its XY point lies inside one of `region.bridge_areas()`. Edge ambiguity (vertex exactly on the boundary) defaults to `false` (strict-inside test).
- Inner-wall `WallBoundaryType` is computed by the same `build_wall_flags` logic as outer walls (with `is_outer=false`). There is no shortcut path. If inner-wall paint is empty, the result is `WallBoundaryType::Interior` (no material boundary); if paint exists with no transitions, `ExteriorSurface`; if transitions exist, `MaterialBoundary { segments: vec![...] }`.
- `Point3WithWidth.overhang_quartile = None` is invariant until the sibling roadmap lands. The deviation registration documents this.
- `only_one_wall_top` triggers when `region.top_shell_index() == Some(0)` (topmost solid layer). Sub-top shells (`Some(1)`, `Some(2)`, …) also trigger via the `split_top_surfaces` carve (top_solid_fill-scoped), implemented this session; no deviation is registered for sub-top reduction.
- `only_one_wall_first_layer` triggers **only** when `_layer_index == 0`. Layer 1 onwards is unaffected.
- `perimeter_utils` consumed from `slicer-core` per docs/13 §Out of Scope. Part of roadmap-wide correction `D-ROADMAP-CRATE-PLACEMENT` (P102, P103, P105, P108, P110, P111, P112 also renamed).
- `overhang_areas()` forward dependency: the IR field `OverhangRegion.xy_footprint: Vec<ExPolygon>` is **net-new — added by P106/O-T010** and absent from the current tree (`OverhangRegion`, `slice_ir.rs:586`, has no footprint field today; `slice_ir.rs:581` is `BridgeRegion.xy_footprint`). Until P106 ships both the field and its population, the host populator returns `Vec::new()` and does NOT reference the field. This is an honest forward-dep, documented in the closure log; the empty return is pinned by AC-3-EMPTY as a regression bed, not treated as a defect.

## Risks and Tradeoffs

- Host-populator `overhang_areas` returns `Vec::new()` until P106 (`106_overhang-pipeline-prepass-foundation`, status: draft) lands. Because `OverhangRegion.xy_footprint` is net-new (added by P106), the populator in THIS packet must not reference it — only the accessor signature + WIT func + empty-stub populator land now. When P106 adds and populates the field, the implementer wires the `xy_footprint`-intersection into the populator body (a small follow-up); the accessor signature does not change. Document in the closure log.
- Inner-wall paint extraction depends on the inner polygon's contour having `segment_annotations` keyed by the inner contour's vertex indices. The current modules build inner walls via iterative offset, and the offset operation does **not** carry paint values forward — segment_annotations are on the original SlicedRegion's polygons, not on the inset polygons. Mitigation: the inner-wall flag computation in this packet uses the **original** region's `segment_annotations`, sampled by nearest-vertex projection from the inner-polygon vertices back to the original-polygon vertices. Documented in `perimeter_utils.rs` doc-comment with a `TODO` for a more precise inner-wall paint sampler in Phase 5 work.
- The `only_one_wall_top`/`only_one_wall_first_layer` gates change wall geometry. Existing single-color test fixtures may have been calibrated against the pre-packet wall count. AC-N2 catches the case where the flag is supposed to be a no-op; the integration-tests-touching files MUST be re-baselined per fixture if needed. Document re-baselined SHAs in the closure log.

## Context Cost Estimate

- Aggregate (sum across all steps): `M`
- Largest single step: `M` (Step 3 — per-vertex is_bridge + inner-wall material boundary propagation across both modules; two-module rewrite + new tests).
- Highest-risk dispatch (the one whose return could blow budget if mis-shaped): "Summarize `docs/02_ir_schemas.md` SurfaceGroup + bridge_areas populator pattern" — MUST return ≤ 150 words. Anything longer likely includes code; re-dispatch tighter.

## Open Questions

- `[FWD]` Inner-wall paint sampling strategy: nearest-vertex projection is a pragmatic stopgap (good enough for most cases; lossy for sub-line-width features). If the implementer finds the regression baseline shifts more than 5% of vertex flags during AC-2 testing, escalate; otherwise document the choice in the perimeter_utils doc-comment and proceed.
- **Resolved** — `flow_factor` config key shape (T-025): no new key registered in this packet. The per-vertex `flow_factor` is hardcoded to `1.0` with a doc-comment citing "future work / flow-compensation algorithm pending". This matches requirements.md §In Scope ("read from config when present; document `1.0` default rationale") and the Step 3 plumbing (`flow_factor = 1.0`). When a future packet introduces the flow-compensation algorithm, it will register the key and replace the `1.0` hardcode in one atomic change.
