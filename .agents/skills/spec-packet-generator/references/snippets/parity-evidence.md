# Parity Evidence Standard

Copy the block exactly into `requirements.md`. Skip it for work with no OrcaSlicer behavior. Never add a second copy to `design.md`.

## Parity Evidence Standard

Every key this packet implements carries evidence per the map's ticket 02 standard:

- **Canonical read + described behaviour.** For each key, cite the canonical consumer (file + function, never line numbers) and describe its behaviour in `requirements.md`. Reads of `OrcaSlicerDocumented/` are delegated per the orca-delegation snippet.
- **Invariants, not goldens.** Behaviour is pinned with invariant/property tests (counts preserved, mappings hold, emitted values equal expected). Golden G-code comparison is not part of the standard — the checkout is not built and cannot be run.
- **Ported Orca tests are acceptable evidence.** When `OrcaSlicerDocumented/tests/fff_print/` covers the behaviour, port its assertions into PnP's suite with the standard porting header (`docs/ORCASLICER_ATTRIBUTION.md`).
- **Plumbing keys** (a threshold feeding an existing decision point): the default resolves to the canonical value AND a test proves the value reaches the consumer. No behavioural test required.
- **Unverifiable behaviour:** surface the key and the reason to the human first; only with their sign-off file a `docs/DEVIATION_LOG.md` row (single source of truth, CI-checked by `cargo xtask check-deviations`) and proceed with documented scope. Never defer the key or block the packet on unverifiability alone, and never file a row without the human having been asked.
